# RSSG
## A rusty static-site generator

### This readme is indicative of the rest of this project: hacky, non-idiomatic, *in need of help*

This SSG is heavily inspired by the [nanoc](https://nanoc.app) SSG.
However, it replaces the loosey-goosey, ill-defined (but powerful) Ruby filter,
layout, routing system with a more well-defined (but less flexible) one that uses
shell commands to preprocess your data.
